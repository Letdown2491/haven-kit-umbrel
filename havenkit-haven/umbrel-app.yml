  Haven is a specialized Nostr relay system that provides a complete infrastructure for managing your Nostr presence.


  Haven consists of five interconnected relay components:

  - Private Relay: Secure storage for drafts and sensitive content

  - Chat Relay: Direct messaging with web-of-trust validation

  - Inbox Relay: Centralized location for mentions and tags

  - Outbox Relay: Public-facing storage for your posts

  - Blossom Media Server: Image and video content hosting


  Easily configure your relay settings, manage backups, and connect to the Nostr network through an intuitive web interface.
