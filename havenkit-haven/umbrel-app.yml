  Haven is a sovereign personal relay for the Nostr protocol, designed for storing
  and backing up sensitive notes like eCash, private chats, and drafts.


  Haven operates as four specialized relays in one application:

  - Private Relay: Restricted to the owner for drafts and sensitive content

  - Chat Relay: For direct messages with web-of-trust filtering

  - Inbox Relay: Aggregates notes where the owner is mentioned

  - Outbox Relay: Publicly accessible storage for owner's posts

  - Blossom Media Server: Hosts images and videos for sharing


  Features include intelligent filtering through web-of-trust protection, automatic
  note aggregation from other relays, cloud backup capabilities, and broadcast
  distribution to multiple relays simultaneously.
